Abstract
--------

Linear Temporal Logic \(LTL\) has found extensive applications in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence,
notably as a formal framework for representing and verifying computer systems that vary over time. Non-monotonic reasoning, on the other hand, allows us to formalize and reason with exceptions and the dynamics of
information. The goal of this paper is therefore to enrich temporal formalisms with non-monotonic reasoning features. We do so by investigating a preferential semantics for defeasible LTL along the lines of that extensively studied by Kraus et al. in the propositional case and recently extended to modal and description logics. The main contribution of the paper is a decidability result for a meaningful fragment of preferential LTL that can serve as the basis for further exploration of defeasibility in temporal formalisms.
